üëæ New request detected... Implementing **Raft Consensus Algorithm** in **Go**! üõ†Ô∏è

The **Raft algorithm** is an alternative to Paxos for achieving consensus in a distributed system. It is more understandable and easier to implement. Raft consists of the following main components:

- **Leader election**: Ensures that one node becomes the leader, and all other nodes follow.
- **Log replication**: Ensures that logs are replicated across all followers.
- **Safety**: Guarantees that only one valid value is committed to the log.

Let's proceed with a basic implementation:

### üõ†Ô∏è **Plan: Raft Implementation in Go**

**Roles in Raft**:
- **Leader**: Handles all client requests and replicates logs.
- **Follower**: Responds to leader's requests.
- **Candidate**: A node that is trying to become the leader.

### üíª **Pseudocode Design**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// Define the Raft states
const (
	Follower = iota
	Candidate
	Leader
)

// Raft node structure
type Raft struct {
	mu             sync.Mutex
	state          int       // Current state: Follower, Candidate, or Leader
	currentTerm    int       // Latest term server has seen
	votedFor       int       // Candidate ID that received vote in current term
	votesReceived  int       // Number of votes received in the election
	log            []LogEntry
	commitIndex    int
	lastApplied    int
	peers          []int     // Other nodes in the cluster
	id             int       // Server ID
	electionTimer  *time.Timer
	heartbeatTimer *time.Timer
}

// LogEntry represents a single log entry
type LogEntry struct {
	Term    int
	Command interface{}
}

// Election timeout duration
var electionTimeout = 1500 * time.Millisecond

// Create a new Raft node
func NewRaft(id int, peers []int) *Raft {
	r := &Raft{
		state:         Follower,
		currentTerm:   0,
		votedFor:      -1,

// Randomize election timeout
func randomElectionTimeout() time.Duration {
	return time.Duration(1500+rand.Intn(1500)) * time.Millisecond

// Run Raft node: handles state transitions

		case Follower:
			r.runFollower()
		case Candidate:
			r.runCandidate()

// Candidate state: start election and request votes
func (r *Raft) runCandidate() {
	r.mu.Lock()
	fmt.Printf("Node %d is a Candidate\n", r.id)
	r.currentTerm++
	r.votedFor = r.id
	r.votesReceived = 1 // Vote for itself
	r.resetElectionTimer()
	r.mu.Unlock()

	// Send RequestVote RPCs to other peers (simulated)
	for _, peer := range r.peers {
		if peer != r.id {
			go r.sendRequestVote(peer)
		}
	}

	// Collect votes and either become leader or restart election
	for r.votesReceived < len(r.peers)/2+1 {

	r.mu.Lock()
	r.state = Leader
	r.mu.Unlock()

// Leader state: send heartbeats to followers
func (r *Raft) runLeader() {
	r.mu.Lock()
	fmt.Printf("Node %d is the Leader\n", r.id)
	r.mu.Unlock()

	// Start sending heartbeats (AppendEntries)
	for {
		r.mu.Lock()
		r.sendHeartbeats()

			go r.sendAppendEntries(peer)

// Simulate RequestVote RPC
func (r *Raft) sendRequestVote(peer int) {

// Reset election timer

func main() {
	// Create a Raft cluster with 5 nodes
	nodes := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

	// Run indefinitely

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Explanation**:

1. **Raft Roles**: 
   - A node starts as a **Follower**.
   - If no heartbeats are received from the leader (timeout), it transitions to a **Candidate** and starts an election.
   - If the **Candidate** receives a majority of votes, it becomes the **Leader** and starts sending **heartbeats** to maintain authority.

2. **Leader Election**:
   - A node increments its term and asks other nodes for votes. Each node can only vote once per term.
   - If the candidate receives a majority of votes, it becomes the leader.
   - If an election times out (no majority), a new election starts.

3. **Heartbeat (AppendEntries)**:
   - The leader periodically sends heartbeats (AppendEntries) to its followers to maintain leadership.

4. **Timers**:
   - **Election timeout**: Used by followers and candidates to start an election if no leader is found.
   - **Heartbeat interval**: Used by the leader to maintain its role by sending heartbeats to followers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **What's Next**:

- Implement **log replication** in the leader.
- Handle **term updates** and **log consistency** to ensure that logs are identical across nodes.
- Handle **persistence** of logs and state in case of node failures.
